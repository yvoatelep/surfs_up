#Surfs up Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to look at historic temperature data for the island of Oahu in the months of December and June, in order to determine if the weather on Oahu is conducive to opening of a surf rental and ice cream shop on one of its beaches. 

### Results for June and December 
*A total of 1700 June temperatures and 1517 December temperatures were compiled and examined to see if the average temperature on the island in those months were suitable for surfing and selling of icecream. 
*Temperatures in June averaged 75 degrees, with a standard deviation of 3.3
	*Minimum temperature for the month of June was 64 degrees, which, although slightly cool, would still be a temperature that would support the sale of ice cream or rental of surf equiptment, especially from tourists visiting from colder climates. 
	*The maximum temperature for June was 85 degrees; perfect beach weather.
	*Temperatures in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles rmain very steady in the mid-70s, between 73 and 77 degrees, perfect for beach weather, including surfing and ice cream. 
	*The details of the analysis are found in the table below, and show that generally the weather on Oahu is favorable for the surf and ice cream shop as determined by temperatures in the month of June.

*Temperatures in December averaged 71 degrees, with a standard deviation of 3.7
	*Minimum temperature for the month of June was 56 degrees, which, slightly cool for ice cream but could still support the rental of surf equiptment for die hard surfers and tourists visiting from colder climates. 
	*The maximum temperature for December was 83 degrees; perfect beach weather.
	*Temperatures in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles rmain very steady in thelow to mid-70s, between 69 and 74 degrees, definitely conducive tosurfing and ice cream. 
	*The details of the analysis are found in the table below, and show that generally the weather on Oahu is favorable for the surf and ice cream shop as determined by temperatures in the month of December.

## Summary
The temperatures analyzed here, 6 months apart and encompassing both summer and winter temps, seem to support the idea that weather on Oahu would support both surfing and the consumption of ice cream, making this business model one that could well prove not just viable, but very successful.
